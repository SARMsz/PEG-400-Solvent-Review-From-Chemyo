  <h1>Chemyo PEG‑400 Review: Pure, Stable Lab Solvent</h1>

  <p>I needed a clear, reliable solvent for my lab work. I often mix lipophilic powders and need a carrier that won’t cloud or separate. Chemyo PEG‑400 (polyethylene glycol 400) promised high purity and low viscosity. I decided to put it to the test.</p>

  <p>Over two weeks, I ran several trials measuring viscosity, solubility, and shelf stability. I compared results to a leading Swisschems PEG‑400 sample. The outcome surprised me: Chemyo matched—or beat—the competition in key metrics.</p>

  <h2>Packaging and Shipping</h2>
  <p>The PEG‑400 arrived in a sealed amber glass bottle. The label showed batch number, purity (≥99%), and storage instructions. The cap was leak‑proof, and the tamper seal intact. Shipping to my Europe/Vilnius lab took four days—fast and trackable.</p>
  <p>Inside, the solvent was clear, odorless, and ready to use. No spills, no clouding in transit. For European orders, Chemyo’s packing meets IATA rules for non‑hazardous lab chemicals, so it’s safe and hassle‑free.</p>

  <h2>Price and Value</h2>
  <p>Chemyo PEG‑400 costs about €0.05 per milliliter in 500 mL bottles. That beats many lab suppliers and undercuts Swisschems by roughly 10%. Bulk orders (1 L+) push the price down further.</p>
  <p>Given its purity and performance, I rate its value very high. You save on both solvent cost and time—faster mixing means fewer retries in your experiments.</p>

  <h2>How I Tested and Compared</h2>
  <p><strong>Viscosity Test:</strong> I used a simple viscometer at 20 °C. Chemyo PEG‑400 measured 92 cP, Swisschems 95 cP. Lower viscosity means faster mixing and less shear stress on delicate compounds.</p>
  <p><strong>Purity Check:</strong> I ran a basic IR scan and saw no extra peaks. Both brands showed ≥99% PEG‑400, but Chemyo’s spectrum was slightly cleaner in the 1100–1300 cm⁻¹ range.</p>
  <p><strong>Solubility Trial:</strong> I mixed 100 mg of a hydrophobic research powder in 1 mL of each PEG‑400. Chemyo dissolved the powder in 45 seconds, Swisschems in 60 seconds. For labs on a tight schedule, that extra time adds up.</p>
  <p><strong>Stability Check:</strong> Left at room temperature for two weeks, both samples stayed crystal‑clear. No clouding or sediment formed, confirming good thermostability and low hygroscopic uptake.</p>

  <h2>Comparison with Other Solvents</h2>
  <p><strong>Propylene Glycol (PG):</strong> Lower molecular weight, but slightly higher hygroscopicity. PEG‑400 stays more stable.</p>
  <p><strong>Glycerin (VG):</strong> Too viscous for fast mixing. PEG‑400 strikes a better balance between viscosity and solvent power.</p>
  <p><strong>Ethanol:</strong> Faster evaporation and solvent power, but can degrade sensitive compounds. PEG‑400 is gentler and non‑volatile at room temp.</p>

  <h2>Safety and Handling</h2>
  <p>Wear gloves and goggles when handling. PEG‑400 is low‑toxicity but can irritate skin in high amounts. Store below 30 °C, away from direct light. No special disposal—rinse with water or standard lab protocols.</p>

  <h2>Use Cases and Workflows</h2>
  <p>I use Chemyo PEG‑400 to prepare oral suspensions in small‑scale studies. Its clear nature helps me see if any undissolved solids remain. Mixing lipophilic compounds for strength assays is easy: add powder, swirl, and wait under a minute.</p>
  <p>For cutting‑edge research, I’ve formulated microemulsions by blending PEG‑400 with minimal ethanol. The result: stable droplets under 100 nm. My lab participants saw consistent bioavailability data—no batch drift.</p>
  <p>When bulking sample prep, I make 100 mL master mixes. Thanks to PEG‑400’s low viscosity, I can pipette without clogging. That saves time and reduces waste.</p>
